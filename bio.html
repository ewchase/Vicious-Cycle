      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Vicious Cycles Inc is a Raleigh-based cycle workshop founded by a few
        like-minded individuals in late 2010. Our mechanics build the bikes and
        man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends to the day-to-day
        operations. We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local
        biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast. We
        believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We
        believe in the significance of individualism. We believe in the stories
        between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the
        circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often. You get on your bike, you
        ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you
        ride again. It’s a Vicious Cycle! So, make it worth the while, don't
        just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live
        your life.

          After spending my whole life on pedals, finishing my degree in
          mechanical engineering, and working for two large companies making
          bikes I decided to change my priorities in life. I’ve never been good
          at sitting in an office waiting for Friday to come so, decided to
          start being self-employed. While I started off with engineering
          projects for companies in the bike industry, I also began to make
          notes and write down ideas for the bike I would make myself. I soon
          felt that my excitement wasn’t going to get any less and decided to
          explore the road of what has now become Vicious!
