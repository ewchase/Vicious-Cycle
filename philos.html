    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Our philosophy is that when you choose your bike, you should choose it
      based on the folks who will not only build your bicycle but also those who
      will help you get comfortable on the bike, as well as provide service down
      the road as you need it. The best things in life are pretty simple. Riding
      bikes with friends, discovering new places, and finding new trails are
      definitely included. Riding bikes helps us to disconnect from the hectic
      and noisy world and connect with friends, nature, and ourselves. It might
      just be the best thing ever. Technological advancement, digital
      exploration, and the growing globalization define the world we live in and
      will bring more change in the years to come than ever before. It’s a world
      full of uncertainties where it’s easy to get lost. But bikes are a very
      rare breed of products that are completely mechanical and analog. There
      aren’t many products that are so simple yet so sophisticated in their
      designs. Maybe that is what started my excitement for bikes as products.
      The process of observing, designing, improving, engineering, and producing
      bikes surely is the second-best thing ever.
